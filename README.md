<h3 align="center">A War card game. This is my first attempt with working with an API</h3>
<br>

## How It's Made:

This was my first attempt at a war card game, I still was not able to implement OOP completely but I was able to make it functional. Usings a lot of if else statements to change the button scnerios.

## Optimizations

I'm planning to add js code to do a second round of war. (Back to back war match). Also need the end game solved for war with less than 5 cards
This is my work in progress War Game.
